This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
DNA.capture.data = read.csv('D:/OneDrive/Manuscript/Chase larval manuscript 2016/data.csv',header=T,na.strings=c(""))
names(DNA.capture.data)[names(DNA.capture.data)=="RRZ.DNA.Present"]<-"DNA"
model <- glm(DNA ~.,family=binomial(link='logit'),data=DNA.capture.data)
summary(model)

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
